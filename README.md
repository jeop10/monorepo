# Monorepo

This is just a demo repo that merges the following repos: "blue", "green" into a monorepo

And this is just a test to prove that I can add a file after the "merge"

The merge was done adding the remotes of the "blue" and "green" and merging them using the
`--allow-unrelated-histories` tag to preserve history from both repositories
